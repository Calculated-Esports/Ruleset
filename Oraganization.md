# Rulebook
## Introduction and Purpose

These official rules of Calculated Esports (CE) apply to every member in this Discord Server. The rules also apply to all the teams, the Team Managers, the Team Captains, the Players and the staff. Everyone in Calculated Esports must follow these rules, otherwise they will get penalized by the CE Management. The CE Management will enforce the ruleset to make sure no rules are broken. 

These rules are designed to ensure the integrity of the system and create a competitive and enjoyable balance amongst the members, the players and the teams in this organisation.

## Teams and Players

### 1.1 Account Vetting

Upon joining a team, CE will make sure your account(s) are eligible for tournaments. By this we mean that we smurf-check you, as we do not allow this in CE. 

### 1.2 Player Names

Here is a list of what we consider inappropriate in all the names:

- Names that suggest hate speech, slurs, or profanity, either implicitly or explicitly. 
- Most names that invoke or refer to something ethical or political.
- Names containing insults, grotesque imagery, and strong vulgarity.

Name changes must be announced to your team manager. 

Also, if you choose to apply team tag to your in-game name (IGN), we recommend you to use "CE *IGN*" (no matter the name eof your team). This is so that you not only represent the team, but you represent the organisation. 

### 1.3 Secondary Accounts

If you are using secondary accounts for ranked frequently, we ask you to announce this to your team manager, as this is relevant both to the CE Management and possibly the management of competitive leagues CE participate in.

### 1.4 Team Settings

For a team to be considered active, it must have at least 5 players, and an assigned Team Manager and Team Captain. Players can be Manager and Captain at the same time as they are players. There is no limit on the number of players and staff members in a team. If a team lack team staff, and the players show no intention of finding new ones, a team can face disbanding, or that the CE Management involve themselves and rebuild the team. If a team need help with finding players or team staff, they can ask the Esports Managers.

### 1.5 Team Name

The Team Name will be freestyle, however CE Management reserves the right to decline names that are considered inappropriate. CE Management encourages the team names to have some sort of synergy with the words "Calculate"/"Calculated"/"Mathematicall correct"/etc.

### 1.6 Discord Server

All players and team staff members must be in our Discord Server: https://discord.gg/z6xJhHXNae

You are expected to behave in the best way possible at all times and to do so in competitive tournaments and leagues too.

If this account turns out to be a banned account, we still want it.
